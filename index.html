            <div class="tiersubheader">About me:</div>
            <div class="tiertext">I have a bachelor's degree in biological engineering from Purdue University and am currently pursuing a master's degree in applied and computational mathematics from the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering. Throughout my undergraduate experience at Purdue, I developed a strong passion for mathematics. I have also developed a respect for the science (and art) of learning. I am a lifelong learner and believe that the ability to continually learn and adapt to new information is one of the most important skills to have in any field. Want proof? You're reading it! On a whim, I thought it may be fun to learn enough HTML and CSS to build a simple website. After a few YouTube videos, this is what I came up with. It certainly won't win any prizes, but I had fun making it!</div>

            <div class="tiertext">To satisfy my affinity towards mathematics and passion of learning, I have dedicated myself to studying applied mathematics. To fulfill my passion of learning, I have focused my studies on the application of mathematics to data science and machine learning: fields that both utilize mathematics and are applicable to many diverse sectors.</div>
